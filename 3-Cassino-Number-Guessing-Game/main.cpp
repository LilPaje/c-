/*The guessing project in C++ is a game designed to test the playerâ€™s luck 
and knowledge. The player needs to guess a random number generated by the 
computer. If the player guesses right, they will win a certain amount of 
money. The winning prize depends on the difficulty of the game. The program 
implements classes, functions, and user-defined data types. It also uses 
other features such as loops and conditionals to create a logical structure. 
Furthermore, it makes use of the standard template library to implement 
basic operations and other data structures.*/
